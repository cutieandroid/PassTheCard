# PassTheCard
It is an android application specially designed for schools and colleges to increase English or any language literacy.
This app consist of proofs which the students can use to pass the card to other students
Card is a digital entity and removes the concept of actual paper or plastic cards
As the card is passed purely on the basis of proofs, this avoids conflicts between students over passing the cards without any proof
The app uses firebase realtime database and firebase storage in the backend
